std::array is a container that encapsulates fixed size arrays.
This container is an aggregate type with the same semantics as a struct holding a C-style array T[N] as its only non-static data member. Unlike a C-style array, it doesn't decay to T* automatically. As an aggregate type, it can be initialized with aggregate-initialization given at most N initializers that are convertible to T: std::array<int, 3> a = {1, 2, 3};.
